# portfolio-v2
My online portfolio - www.fhuszti.com

Newest version of my online portfolio that I use to show my work, and as a sandbox/training ground for me to try out what I learn.

I plan on using BootStrap, jQuery and procedural PHP in this version.
Note that I might create a repo for the current v1 of my portfolio when v2 goes online to keep track of my progress.
