My online portfolio - https://www.fhuszti.com

Newest version of my online portfolio that I use to show my work, and as a sandbox/training ground for me to try out what I learn.

In this version I'm using Symfony 4, with Twig and jQuery for the front-end.
I also keep all previous versions of my portfolio locally to keep track of my progress.
